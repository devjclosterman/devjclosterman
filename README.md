  <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center;">Welcome!</p>
  <p>For the past year, I have been learning LLMs and AI automation, so regretfully, you see a huge gap in my commits. Now that I have sharpened my skills, I will do my best to get a Green Dot Every Day! I love coding, tech is so broad, and there is so much to learn. I know how important GitHub is.</p>

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
Website for Desert Forged Ai  

### Project 1
https://chicago-grit.com

### Project 2
Launched a website that is not finished, thought I would show the process. Also, I like doing mobile-responsive queries while the site is live, So I can test across all browsers.

### Project 3
Everyday I code, I am currently building bots with chatGPT-4..exciting! I want to build a Plug-in that is a bot for each company and website. The bot will learn about your company and clients to assist you further.
